# fpga_learning

This repository showcases projects and notes from the book "_Getting Started with FPGAs_" by Russell Merrick. The goal of using this book is to grasp the basics and further my understanding of HDL and FPGAs for embedded applications, as embedded systems/programming is an interest of mine.
